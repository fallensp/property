# Feature Specification: Listing Creation Frontend

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-listing-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build a frontend app that allow me to create listing, only need to focus on frontend, no need for backend intergration. focus on ui, refer to prd.md and all the screenshot in current dir. user experience and the step flow is pirority"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete Listing Wizard (Priority: P1)

An agent completes the multi-step listing creation wizard, entering required information for property type, location, details, pricing, description, media, and previewing before submission.

**Why this priority**: This is the core workflow that delivers value; without it the UI does not enable new listings.

**Independent Test**: Execute the end-to-end wizard journey in a controlled environment, confirming required fields block progress until satisfied and the final preview reflects inputs.

**Automated Tests**: Run automated end-to-end UI journeys that cover all wizard steps, plus component tests verifying validation messages for required fields.

**Experience & Accessibility Notes**: Follow PRD screenshots for layout; ensure keyboard navigation, focus order, and descriptive labels exist for every input; replicate helper copy and validation language provided in prd.md.

**Performance Budget**: Largest Contentful Paint for each step load ≤ 2.5s on simulated 3G Fast networks; interactive validation feedback ≤ 150ms p95.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent is on Step 1 with no selections, **When** they select property category and listing purpose, **Then** the “Next” button activates and Step 2 becomes accessible.
2. **Given** the agent has completed all steps with valid data, **When** they open the Preview step, **Then** the preview displays the entered data organized per PRD layout with no missing required sections.

### User Story 2 - Guided Validation & Step Control (Priority: P2)

An agent receives real-time feedback when attempting to proceed with missing or invalid data and can move backward to earlier steps without losing previously entered information.

**Why this priority**: Guards data quality and preserves user confidence in a lengthy, multi-step experience.

**Independent Test**: Start the wizard, intentionally omit required fields to trigger errors, then navigate backward/forward verifying state persistence and resolved validation.

**Automated Tests**: Component-level validation tests for each step; journey tests covering backward navigation, state persistence, and error resolution.

**Experience & Accessibility Notes**: Error messages must match the tone in prd.md, appear inline beneath fields, and be announced to screen readers; progress sidebar must reflect current step status (complete, active, blocked) through color and icon cues.

**Performance Budget**: Validation feedback appears within 150ms p95; step transitions render within 200ms to maintain flow continuity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent leaves the selling price empty on the Price step, **When** they tap “Next,” **Then** the price input shows an inline error (“Price cannot be empty”), the field is highlighted, and the wizard remains on the Price step.
2. **Given** the agent has populated earlier steps, **When** they navigate back from the Description step to Listing Type, **Then** previous selections remain intact and validation indicators stay accurate.

### User Story 3 - Media & Preview Readiness (Priority: P3)

An agent manages listing media within the Gallery step, meeting minimum photo requirements, ordering items, and confirming that the Preview stage reflects chosen assets and platform toggles.

**Why this priority**: High-quality media presentation is critical to listing effectiveness and forms a major differentiator in the flow.

**Independent Test**: Populate preceding steps, upload a mix of media assets to satisfy minimum requirements, rearrange photos, and verify the Preview renders chosen assets and highlights unmet constraints.

**Automated Tests**: UI interaction tests covering media upload placeholders, minimum photo enforcement, reorder actions, and preview synchronization.

**Experience & Accessibility Notes**: Tile layouts and helper copy must align with PRD; provide keyboard-accessible controls for uploads, reorder, and delete; include alt-text prompts for assistive users.

**Performance Budget**: Gallery thumbnails must appear within 2s after selection; preview rendering updates within 300ms after media adjustments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** fewer than five photos are present, **When** the agent attempts to proceed, **Then** the gallery displays the “Add more photos to proceed” alert and the “Next” button remains disabled.
2. **Given** the agent reorders photos in the gallery, **When** they open the Preview step, **Then** the hero image and carousel reflect the updated order.

### Edge Cases

- Network hiccup or large file selection interrupts media upload; the UI must surface retry guidance without crashing the flow.
- Autocomplete location search returns no matches; provide fallback messaging and allow manual entry consistent with PRD helper text.
- Accessibility mode users navigating via keyboard or assistive technology must be able to complete all steps and perceive validation hints.
- Mobile viewport or reduced window width should gracefully stack sections without hiding required controls or validation states.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The wizard MUST present all steps outlined in prd.md (Listing Type, Location, Unit Details, Price, Description, Gallery, Platform Posting, Preview) with a persistent progress indicator.
- **FR-002**: Each step MUST enforce required fields using inline validation that prevents progression until resolved.
- **FR-003**: The Location step MUST provide search with suggestion feedback and display the selected property on a map preview consistent with supplied imagery.
- **FR-004**: The Gallery step MUST require a minimum of five photos, support additional media types (videos, floorplans, virtual tours), and expose reorder and delete controls.
- **FR-005**: The Preview step MUST surface a read-only summary mirroring the final listing layout, highlighting unmet requirements when applicable.
- **FR-006**: The UI MUST preserve state across navigation, including backward movement and soft refresh (e.g., reloading a step within the session).
- **FR-007**: The Platform Posting step MUST allow toggling platform availability and scheduling options as described in prd.md even without backend integration (use simulated data).

### Testing Requirements *(Principle II)*

- **TR-001**: Automated end-to-end UI tests MUST cover the full wizard happy path, ensuring each required field gates progress until satisfied.
- **TR-002**: Automated tests MUST simulate validation edge cases per step (e.g., missing price, insufficient photos, invalid numeric ranges) and confirm correct error messaging.
- **TR-003**: Regression tests MUST verify that state persistence survives step navigation and preview synchronization after media or field updates.

### Experience & Accessibility Requirements *(Principle III)*

- **XR-001**: Layouts, typography, helper copy, and iconography MUST align with prd.md descriptions and accompanying screenshots for visual fidelity.
- **XR-002**: Every interactive element MUST have keyboard focus states, aria labels where context is not obvious, and maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios.
- **XR-003**: Validation and status indicators MUST communicate via both color and text/iconography to remain perceivable to color-impaired users.

### Performance Requirements *(Principle IV)*

- **PR-001**: Initial render of each wizard step MUST keep Largest Contentful Paint ≤ 2.5s on reference devices and networks documented in the constitution.
- **PR-002**: Interaction latency for step transitions and validation feedback MUST remain ≤ 150ms at p95 under normal asset sizes.
- **PR-003**: Gallery image thumbnail processing MUST not block the UI thread; previews should appear within 2s per asset selection.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Listing Draft**: Aggregates all step data (type, location, details, pricing, description, media, platform settings) and tracks validation status by step.
- **Media Asset**: Represents uploaded photos, videos, floorplans, and virtual tours, including type, order, captions/alt text, and compliance flags (e.g., minimum photo count).
- **Wizard Step State**: Captures completion status, error messages, and navigation metadata for each step to manage progress indicators and gating.

### Assumptions

- Backend services are unavailable; all data persists client-side for the session with optional local caching to reduce re-entry during the same visit.
- Location search uses a mocked dataset and the map preview leverages existing static imagery or client-side mapping widgets without external API calls.
- Media uploads rely on client-side file handling; files are not transmitted to a server but are previewed and validated locally.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of usability study participants complete the full listing wizard in under 12 minutes without facilitator intervention.
- **SC-002**: At least 95% of observed validation errors are resolved by users within two attempts, indicating clear guidance.
- **SC-003**: 90% of participants rate the flow “consistent” or higher regarding visual and interaction fidelity with provided screenshots.
- **SC-004**: Performance test sessions confirm step loads and interactions meet the defined LCP and latency budgets on target devices.
