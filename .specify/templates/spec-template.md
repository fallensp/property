# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

  Constitution alignment:
  - Principle II: Declare the automated tests that will fail before this story is implemented.
  - Principle III: Capture UX consistency, copy sources, and accessibility checkpoints.
  - Principle IV: State the performance budget and how it will be measured.
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Automated Tests**: [List unit/integration/E2E suites that will cover this story]

**Experience & Accessibility Notes**: [Reference design tokens, copy docs, validation states, WCAG considerations]

**Performance Budget**: [Define target metric(s) and measurement approach]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Automated Tests**: [List unit/integration/E2E suites that will cover this story]

**Experience & Accessibility Notes**: [Reference design tokens, copy docs, validation states, WCAG considerations]

**Performance Budget**: [Define target metric(s) and measurement approach]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?
- Are accessibility fallbacks provided when [assistive technology scenario]?
- Does latency remain within [performance budget] under [stress condition]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Testing Requirements *(Principle II)*

- **TR-001**: Automated tests MUST cover [critical behavior] with failing-first assertions.
- **TR-002**: Integration/E2E tests MUST verify [primary journey] end-to-end.
- **TR-003**: Regression tests MUST be updated to cover [edge condition or bug fix].

### Experience & Accessibility Requirements *(Principle III)*

- **XR-001**: UX MUST follow [design system tokens/component names].
- **XR-002**: Copy MUST reference [approved source or content doc].
- **XR-003**: Accessibility MUST include [focus order, aria labels, contrast checks].

### Performance Requirements *(Principle IV)*

- **PR-001**: [Page/interaction] MUST achieve LCP â‰¤ [value] on [device/network].
- **PR-002**: Interactive response MUST stay under [latency] at p95.
- **PR-003**: Backend/API MUST sustain [load metrics] without breaching budgets.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
